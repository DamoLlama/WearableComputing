Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

See 'data/README.txt'for information on the original data. All data for this project is sourced from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and is located in the data folder of this R Project 'WearableComputing'


One R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
